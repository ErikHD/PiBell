# PiBell

PiBell is an open source application developed for Raspberry Pi that aims to make ringing someone's doorbell a fun, convenient and helpful experience. It employs LibLinphone, a high level librabry for handling SIP calls as well as a camera with microphone. The code is written Python üêç. The idea is that once a button is pushed, the Linphone application automatically starts an outgoing call to a pre determined Linphone user/phone. Contact will then exist between the camera and its microphone, and the phone.
Any help or contribution is welcome.
